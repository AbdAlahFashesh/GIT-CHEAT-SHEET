# User Story Sheet (General Reference)

A reusable checklist for writing strong user stories.  
Organized around the **3 common failure modes**.

---

# 1. Vague Role

##  Problem
Stories use unclear roles:
> “As a user…”

→ No clear stakeholder  
→ No clear value  

---

##  What to watch for
- Generic roles (“user”, “someone”)
- Missing stakeholder context
- No clear responsibility

---

## Questions to ask
- Who is actually using this?
- Who benefits from this?
- Who is affected if this fails?

---

## How to fix
Use **specific roles**:
- Customer
- Admin
- Support agent
- Student
- Manager

---

##  Pattern

 Bad:
> As a user, I want to upload a file

Good:
> As a customer, I want to upload a document so that I can complete my application

---

# 2. Untestable Criteria

##  Problem
Requirements like:
- “fast”
- “easy”
- “user-friendly”

→ Cannot be tested  
→ Cannot define “done”

---

##  What to watch for
- Missing numbers
- No measurable outcome
- No pass/fail condition

---

##  Questions to ask
- How fast is “fast”?
- What does success look like?
- What should happen if something fails?

---

##  How to fix
Make criteria:
- measurable
- specific
- testable

---

##  Given / When / Then

```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
```

---

## Pattern

Bad:
> The system should load quickly

Good:
> The page loads in under 2 seconds

---

#  3. Too-Big Scope

##  Problem
Story is too large (epic disguised as a story)

→ Cannot be completed quickly  
→ Hard to estimate  
→ Hard to test  

---

##  What to watch for
- Multiple features in one story
- “and” appears multiple times
- Covers a full workflow

---

##  Questions to ask
- Can this be done in a few days?
- Can I test it independently?
- Can it be split into smaller parts?

---

## 🛠 How to fix
Break into **smaller, independent stories**

---

##  Pattern

Bad:
> As a user, I want to manage my account

Better:
> As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access

---

# User Story Template

```
As a [specific role],
I want [specific action],
so that [clear value].
```

---

# Acceptance Criteria Template

```
Given [initial state]
When [action]
Then [expected result]
```

---

# Quick Checklist

- [ ] Role is specific (not “user”)
- [ ] Value is clear
- [ ] Criteria are testable
- [ ] No vague words
- [ ] Story is small enough

---

# Red Flags

- fast
- simple
- easy
- user-friendly

Always ask: “What does that mean exactly?”

---

# Common Conflicts

- Speed vs reliability
- Simplicity vs flexibility
- Offline vs consistency

---

# Final Insight

A good user story is:
- **Specific**
- **Testable**
- **Small**

If one fails → the story fails.
